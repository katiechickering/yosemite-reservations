# 🏕️ Yosemite Campsite Reservations


## 🌟 Highlights

- Reserve your spot at one of Yosemite's beautiful campsites
- Search the reservations page by campsite
- Edit, view or delete your reservations as needed
- Read about Yosemite news and information


## ℹ️ Overview

This project was built with a Node.js and Express backend and a React frontend styled with Tailwind CSS. It uses a single MongoDB collection and integrates data from the National Park Service public API. The reservation feature provides full CRUD functionality. The goal of this project is to showcase my expertise in the MERN stack. I also created the Park Information tab to display my ability in working with external APIs and modern frontend styling.
